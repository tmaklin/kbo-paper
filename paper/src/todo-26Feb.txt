NEW April
- Define a standard for MS and DMS
- In figure 1 we have 4 strings as reference and 1 query. Is this correct?
- Check figure 3
- $t_p$ or just $t$?
- check section "Filling gaps in the translated alignment"
- add a description of every method "find, call, variant calling" at the end of introduction


- replace SNP with SNV





General comments:

1. In the Methods section there are two enumerates that might look better formatted as pseudocode. Can we change them?

2. Would it be possible to add the MS vector and t to Figure 3? We believe it would make it easier to understand how dMS is derived.

3. SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) can be where one base is changed for another or when an individual base is inserted or deleted from the sequence. It would be preferable to avoid using the term SNP, if possible, and just stick with single nucleotide substitution if that is what we want here, to distinguish between that and an insertion. Your thoughts? TM: Re the point about polymorphism vs substitution, your comment reminds me that this is relevant in the algorithm: if the refinement step mentioned has not been run, then the algorithm can't resolve 1bp insertion or substitution vs. substitution, so should be careful here. I agree SNP is not the best term in general.

TODO:
1. Check and maybe rewrite introduction (There are 3 TODOs)
2. The 3 figures have different fonts: 1 ?, 2 Helvetica, 3? We would like to use the font in Elena's figure for all, if you agree.
3. Refine figure 1 + add a longer caption
4. Check correctness of figure 3
5. Explain how the LCS is used + Add figure 4
6. 2 TODOs in the methods section
7. Add experimental results
8. Write discussion section

TM email 24, Feb: 
Looking at the overleaf the big things to do are:
- Finish description of the algorithm and revise the parts that are already there, they are a bit unclear.
- Add some simple demonstrations and quick benchmarks vs other algorithms (I have designed and run these, need to add them to the text).
- Finish the browser GUI, it currently has all the functionality of the CLI but needs means to export the output and some cleaning up to make it less intimidating.
- Write discussion and revise the introduction.
- Polish the figures.

From my perspective contributions to the introduction and the discussion would be valuable, as I don't know the algorithmic bioinformatics literature very well. Any feedback on the code / documentation / cli and gui would also be helpful but this is not super relevant for getting the paper submitted.
